# OS Kernel Series - Pre-built ISOs

This repository holds pre-built ISO files for my [operating system tutorial series](https://github.com/davidcallanan/os-series).

If you don't trust executing these ISOs, you can always [build your own copy from source](https://github.com/davidcallanan/os-series).

TODO: I need to upload the ISOs
